    <h2>Terrain Notes:</h2>
    <h6>1. Landforms</h5>
    <p>
Forest Cycles

1. Forest development mainly depends on variations of precipitation, elevation, temperature, and sunlight, as well as animal migrations, and decomposition.

Forest Formation & Ecological Succession

1. Primary succession for forests starts with grasses, herbs, ferns, and fungi (or lichens then mosses beforehand), from which shrublands develop, followed by young and small trees and vines, and then mature and large trees, eventually forming old growth with a closed canopy climax, shading out seedlings.

2. Secondary succession can occur following wildfires, floods, landslides, or blights. Some of these can create snag forests with standing limbless trees but abundant biodiversity, which contrasts against a more limited secondary growth after deforestation.

3. Forests can also shift toward swamp or savanna or desert states.

Tree Parts

1. Trees develop hard bark exteriors, forming as annual rings of earlywood and latewood. Their main trunk (bole) supports both big branches (boughs) and twigs, plus foliage and blossoms, sometimes catkin flower clusters.

2. Trees reach into the ground with roots, the crowns of which can sometimes form lignotuber protrusions. They transport sap within themselves, and may self-repair using pitch. Hard knots can form where branches once grew, and hollow cavities form as well.

Non-Tree Parts

1. Fungi like yeasts, mildews, molds, and mushrooms decompose detritus in woodlands, sometimes in fairy ring formations, or as polypores fruiting on trees.

2. Vines climb, whereas underground stems like bulbs, corms, rhizomes, and tubers burrow.

3. Forbs, herbs other than grasses, sedges, and rushes, flesh out the ground layers of forests.

Basic Tree Categories

1. Deciduous trees shed their leaves annually, whereas evergreen shed theirs gradually or stay green year-round. Deciduous most often appear as hard wood with broad leaves, whereas evergreen most often appear as conifers: soft wood with needles or scales and cone-like fruit. Rare deciduous conifers also exist.

Forest Layers

1. The Forest Floor contains decomposing leaves and needles, animal droppings, and fallen trees, and this decay becomes soil. Dense canopies above can reduce sunlight and thus vegetation here, unless near water or clearings. Above this, young trees, bushes, shrubs, snags, and leafy herbs comprise the Understory Layer, relatively open but dark. Waterways or clearings can become thickets.

3. The majority of biodiversity resides in the Canopy Layer, marked by tall tees and overlapping treetop connected by ranches, twigs, leaves, vines, mosses, and lichens. Above this, the Emergent Layer features giant crowned trees in higher sunlight, temperature, and winds.

Tree Group Terms

1. Groups of similar trees appear as stands. Hammocks refer to islands of trees contrasting with nearby ecosystems, whereas dense stands become thickets.

2. Without much undergrowth, groves form, and trees cut down to stools then regrown create multiple, smaller shoots (copses).

Tropical Forests

1. Tropical forests have wet and dry seasons, with overall consistent sunlight and temperature, and abundant rainfall, including through monsoon seasons. Little fertile soil but high biodiversity.

2. Year-round rain shape tropical evergreen rainforests, whereas short dry seasons shape tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, and longer dry seasons shape tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf and coniferous forests.

3. Montane and laurel forests get water mostly from mist or fog at high elevation, whereas flooded forests arise as submerged swamp.

Temperate Forests

1. Temperate Forests have Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter seasons.

2. Mild wet winters and dry summers shape moist coniferous and evergreen broadleaf forests. At higher elevations, dry coniferous forests form.

3. Temperate broadleaf rainforest have mild winters and consistent rain, whereas Mediterranean forests have dry summers and rainy winters; both evergreen.

Boreal Forests

1. Boreal forests (taiga) have a mild Summer and a long Winter season.

2. Southernmost taiga have dense trees with mossy groundcover, whereas northernmost taiga have sparse and stunted trees with lichen groundcover.

Transitional Forests

1. Low-density forests with much open habitat and sunlight manifest as woodlands, which can mix with grasslands to become savanna.

2. Dry transitional forests can appear as heat-tolerant, hard-leaved sclerophyllous, or as thorn forests, which can turn into savanna or desert. Wet ones can arise as mangroves: coastal swamps.

Special Forests

1. Rarer forests can manifest with massive swollen trunks (baobob) or tall skinny trunks (bamboo), or with upturned crowns (dragon’s blood). And they can even have thorny bark (kapok), or fruiting bark (grapetree), or colorful bark (rainbow eucalyptus).

2. They can also have dense overgrowth (jungle) or overruns (spider trees). Finally, they can have massive size (redwood and tetrameles).

Deformation & Damages

1. Trees can have abnormal growths like burls or galls or witch’s brooms above, or geoxyles at root. Dead and dying trees become snags.

2. Frost heaving can cause tilted or crooked trees. Wind can cause windsnap at trunk or windthrow uprooting.

Wood Seasons

1. Earlywood in Spring has lighter color, more softness and porosity, whereas latewood in Summer has the opposite.

2. The central heartwood of trees has a darker, dense, and dead core providing strength, whereas the outer sapwood has a lighter, looser, living bands transporting nutrients.

    <h6>2. Waterforms</h5>
    <p>
Coastal Cycles – Currents, Tides, Vortexes, Waves

1. Coasts have many currents, with the tidal cycle of flood, high, ebb, and low tide, transitioning through slack tides, being particularly influential, and which sometimes results in storm surge or reverse storm surge. Tides gradually erode landforms. Ocean currents more broadly determine the continuous background movement of the sea and how waves and wind and related phenomena impact things like temperature and salinity, as well as shoreline configurations.

2. Powerful underwater disturbances can on occasion form tidal waves, whereas powerful storm systems can produce tropical cyclones. Weaker storm systems can produce rotational currents like waterspouts. Other rotational current phenomena include fog-sucking steam devils, and whirlpools.

3. More localized currents include undertow and rip currents along the near shore and surf zone, more shallow and stationary tide pool habitats deposited by nearby waters.

Coast Formation & Ecological Succession

1. Rivers, glacial melt, shoreline erosion, and marine organisms can deposit sediment, which moves onshore by wave, tide, and wind currents, forming beaches.

2. Coastal dunes can show normal grassland to woodland progression. Habitats span from off-shore sandbars to submerged beach, intertidal beach, and upper beach, to primary dunes and inter-dune meadows, and potentially to shrub zones, shrub forests, and maritime climax forests.

3. Coral reefs form when swimming hard coral larvae attach to hard submerged surfaces like rock and edges of islands or continents and form symbiotic relations with algae, secreting calcium carbonate. The bodies and activity of algae, seaweed, sponges, and mollusks adds to reef structures, as does sediment. Reefs progress toward fringing, barrier, or atoll states.

Horizontal Coastal Landforms

1. Beaches form from wind and wave action, erosion and deposition, and can feature sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, cobblestone, boulders, driftwood, and shells.

2. Pockets can form between headlands, and headlands can feature terraces.

3. Isthmuses, shoals (sandbars), and tombolos connect lands separated by expanses of water, and clusters of tombolos can form enclosures called lagoons.

Indents & Inlets

1. Bodies of recessed coastal waters can form larger inlets like bays and gulfs and sounds, smaller inlets like coves, narrow inlets like fjords and geos, wider inlets like bights, or branching inlets like rias.

2. Narrow indents like blowholes, sea caves, and surge channels arise from water erosion on smaller scales.

Islands & Reefs

1. Waves, wind, and tides can form ridges and dunes which become barrier beaches or islands, allowing wetlands to form.

2. Durable underwater landmasses called islands or isles, and islets, protrude above the water line. Unconnected groups of islands become arcs or archipelagos, or if connected, tidal islands and tied islands. Includes less habitable ones, such as desert islands, icebergs, skerries, and vanishing islands.

3. Underwater chains of rocks, corals, or sand where corals and algae aggregate form reefs, which, with islands can encircle lagoons to for m atolls, or if attached to a shore, a fringing reef, and table reefs if attached to continental shelf. Abovewater, this forms a cay (key).

Vertical Coastal Landforms

1. Beaches can have tall ridges or cliffs, sometimes very steep, typically formed of rock; headlands and capes refer to the larger ones.

2. Tidal erosion beneath can create sea arches, and that erosion can also create sea stacks.

    <h6>3. Ambience</h5>
    <p>
Rock Formations

1. “Rock Formation” refers to any isolated, scenic, or spectacular surface rock outcrop, sculpted from weathering or erosion.

Sedimentary Rock 101

1. Sedimentary Rock forms through gradual accumulation and compaction of sediments like sand or mud via water and wind action; exposed via erosion. Examples: sandstone, limestone, gypsum.

2. Includes porous and not very dense textures (clastic, bioclastic, and microclastic). Also includes textures with interlocking networks of visible crystals (crystalline and microcrystalline). Plus rocks containing abundant fossils.

Igneous Rock 101

1. Igneous Rock forms through cooling and crystallization of melt or magma. Includes plutons (subsurface magma crystallization) and volcanic extrusives (lava, pyroclastics, volcanic ash).

2. Textures include fine microscopic crystals (aphanitic), amorphous glass (glassy), rapidly expanded minerals (pegmatitic), large visible crystals (phaneritic), fine-grained matrices enclosing large crystals (porphyritic), and glassy fragments (pyroclastic).

Metamorphic Rock 101

1. Metamorphic Rock forms as one rock type transforms into another, via heat, pressure, or chemical change, with a new composition and fabric.

2. Textures include striped minerals with coarse foliation (gneissose), polygonal minerals with grain triple junctions (granoblastic), interlocking fine-grained minerals (hornfelsic), parallel minerals with foliation (schistose), and parallel minerals with microscopic grains (slaty).

Bedrock, Exposures, Outcrops

1. Within the surface of the planet’s crust, solidified rock (bedrock) lays under loose, softer material (regolith).

2. Visible exposures of bedrock can looking uncovered from subsurface material (rock exposures). These can look chiseled, and either protrusive, flat, or concave. Similarly, they can also manifest as rock outcrops, where erosion exceeds weathering. These can look rounded and protrusive.

Ore Deposits, Shears, Veins

1. Linear rock deformations from compressive stress (shears), as well as sheetlike bodies of crystallized minerals within rock (veins), can create openings for rock or sediment bearing valuable minerals or metals (ore deposits).

Mesostructures

1. Cooled igneous rock can form large intrusive masses (batholith), or conical structures following lava ejection (hornito).

2. Rock exposures can manifest as bare rocky elements of an otherwise icy ridge, mountain, or peak (nunatak and rognon), while rock outcrops can manifest or as large, freestanding hilltops standing stark above the surrounding smooth and gentle slopes of a summit or crest (tor).

Fins, Arches, Tunnels, Windows

1. Over time, water erosion and differential weathering can wear down edges of megastructures like buttes, mesas, and plateaus, producing facets like fins, which can wear down further, developing into arches or tunnels or windows, and later on potentially hoodoos or pillars of other sorts as well.

2. Fins have narrow, residual walls of hard sedimentary rock remaining after erosion. Arches, double arches, and sea arches appear as rock arches or bridges with openings underneath. Tunnel rocks have narrow tunnels running through their mass, and similarly, window rocks have masses where gaps function as crude windows.

Hoodoos

1. Rock pillars which protrude from the bottom of an arid drainage basin or badland manifest as hoodoos, including fairy chimneys arising from volcanic eruption material. Sometimes hoodoos aggregate into large clusters called hoodoo amphitheaters.

2. Differential wind erosion and weathering can create mushroom-shaped rock pillars, whereas visually-similar tea tables arise as sedimentary rock stacks, and ventifact pillars arise from abrasion, pitting, etching, grooving, or polishing. Related to ventifact, sandblasted hollows can contribute to streamlined, wind-formed ridges exposed down to bedrock (yardang).

Bonus Pillars, Spires, Towers

1. Rock pillars, natural structures of upright stone, typically detached, can manifest in many additional forms, including close together or partially-connected rock pillar clusters, and the wide horizontal arrays of rock pillar fields.

2. Rock pillars can also appear as spires, which taper toward the top, which can also form clusters and fields.

3. Rock pillars can also appear as very tall stone towers, which can also form clusters and fields, as well as tall, isolated rock masses appearing as near-vertical joints and fractures erode downward (stone tower karst). Stone colonnades refer to groups of vertical, weight-bearing rock columns attached to an overheard surface.

Balanced Rocks

1. Large rocks or boulders, sometimes of substantial size, resting on other rocks, bedrock, or glacial till, can manifest as balancing rocks, including boulder bridges from rockfall. This also includes balancing erratics moved by glacial action.

2. Some rock formations persist after extensive wind, water, or chemical erosion (erosional remnants). This can appear as flat discs atop rock pillars (hat rocks), as glacially-moved boulders contrasting in size and type from the area they rest in (glacial erratic), or as large, detached rock fragments transported to a hill or slope resting place.

Boulders & Domes

1. Domes can arise as steep, bald outcroppings (bornhardts), as projections from subterranean intrusions (cupola), or as one-sided granite formations (half-dome).

2. Gradually, freeze-thaw action can crack open boulders (cleft and hollow boulders), and water erosion can leave sphere boulders along coastlines.

Rock Slopes

1. Rock formations functioning as slopes manifest in many varieties; intensive processes can create isolated pillow or ball protrusions after massive shocks to unconsolidated sediment, or v-shaped folds arising from compressive stress (chevron folds), or interlocking polygonal prisms of basalt arising from volcanic eruption.

2. In contrast, more subtle preferential weathering over time can create concave rock walls (flared slopes), and gradual wind and rain can create colorful rainbow sandstone slopes. Also, as an aboveground counterpart to speleothems, hot springs can slowly create mineral terraces.

Rock Expanses

1. Softer flatland rock formations can manifest as dried mudcracks, or raindrop impressions in soft sediment.

2. Harder flatland rock formations can arise as glacial retreat carves bald topographies of exposed slabs and fissures (limestone pavement), as coastal wave erosion creates narrow patterned platforms, or as various processes generate fractured rectangular mosaics (tesselated pavement).

Rock Intrusions

1. Igneous rock intrusions can manifest as relatively thin and elliptical downward cone sheets, as circular ring dikes with steep contacts from collapsed calderas, and as erosional remnant masses of country rock projecting downward (roof pendants).

2. Dikes more broadly arise as vertical rock sheets formed in a fracture, with sedimentary origin. Related tabular sheet intrusions called sill intrude between preexisting layers of various rock.

Look-Alikes

1. Rock formations can resemble real-world biological elements, like humanoid creatures and other animals, as well as plants.

2. Rock formations can also resemble real-world manufactured elements, like cobblestones, lighthouses, organ pipes, or stairways.
